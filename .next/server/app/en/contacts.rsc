19:T412,The Erasmus+ CBHE project "Digital University – Open Ukrainian Initiative" (DigiUni), aims to develop an open digital education environment for Ukrainian universities. This initiative is in response to the challenges posed by the russian federation's aggression and the subsequent damage to Ukraine's higher education system. The project emphasizes the importance of digitalization for the continuity and success of educational institutions in Ukraine. It seeks to leverage European universities' experience in developing integrated digital solutions and to foster cooperation between Ukrainian and European partners. Our consortium of Ukrainian and European universities is strongly committed to share expertise in order to support and develop an open digital education environment for Ukrainian universities.

The Digital University – Open Ukrainian Initiative (DigiUni) proposes to start the process of creating a full-fledged, integrated, sustainable, enriching, inclusive and high-performing digital educational ecosystem in Ukraine.10:["$","$L18",null,{"locale":"en","now":"$D2024-10-30T18:03:39.514Z","timeZone":"Europe/Kiev","messages":{"nav":{"main":"Main","about":"About","programs":"Programs","news":"News","contacts":"Contacts","navigation":"Navigation"},"main":{"slogan":{"creatingFirst":"Developing a digital ecosystem for Ukrainian universities"},"about":{"enumerationCaption":"About project","title":"Erasmus+ Program.
