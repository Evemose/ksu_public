4a:T605,The Erasmus+ CBHE DigiUni project, with the full name "Digital University - Open Ukrainian Initiative", is an important initiative aimed at supporting higher education in Ukraine in the conditions of martial law and post-war reconstruction. Currently, this is the largest Erasmus+ project ever implemented in Ukraine.

This project was developed in response to the unprecedented challenges associated with the full-scale invasion of Russia in Ukraine, and aims to harmonize the processes of digital transformation in education, creating a single digital educational ecosystem to ensure continuous, high-quality, inclusive and transparent education​​​​ . The project emphasizes the importance of digitization for the continuity and success of educational institutions in Ukraine. It aims to use the experience of European universities in the development of integrated digital solutions and to promote cooperation between Ukrainian and European partners.

In 2023, the European Commission opened a special window for Ukraine under the Erasmus+ program in response to the challenges faced by Ukrainian higher education due to the full-scale Russian invasion and its consequences. The Ministry of Education and Science of Ukraine, together with Ukrainian partner universities, worked on a proposal that would combine a systematic approach, broad influence and cooperation of all Ukrainian higher education institutions. According to the results of the selection, the DigiUni project became the winner, and European partners supported it.12:["$","$L49",null,{"locale":"en","now":"$D2024-07-11T14:14:42.497Z","timeZone":"Europe/Kiev","messages":{"nav":{"main":"Main","about":"About","programs":"Programs","news":"News","contacts":"Contacts"},"main":{"slogan":{"creatingFirst":"Creating first ukrainian digital university together"},"about":{"enumerationCaption":"About project","title":"Erasmus+ program.

54:T605,The Erasmus+ CBHE DigiUni project, with the full name "Digital University - Open Ukrainian Initiative", is an important initiative aimed at supporting higher education in Ukraine in the conditions of martial law and post-war reconstruction. Currently, this is the largest Erasmus+ project ever implemented in Ukraine.

This project was developed in response to the unprecedented challenges associated with the full-scale invasion of Russia in Ukraine, and aims to harmonize the processes of digital transformation in education, creating a single digital educational ecosystem to ensure continuous, high-quality, inclusive and transparent education​​​​ . The project emphasizes the importance of digitization for the continuity and success of educational institutions in Ukraine. It aims to use the experience of European universities in the development of integrated digital solutions and to promote cooperation between Ukrainian and European partners.

In 2023, the European Commission opened a special window for Ukraine under the Erasmus+ program in response to the challenges faced by Ukrainian higher education due to the full-scale Russian invasion and its consequences. The Ministry of Education and Science of Ukraine, together with Ukrainian partner universities, worked on a proposal that would combine a systematic approach, broad influence and cooperation of all Ukrainian higher education institutions. According to the results of the selection, the DigiUni project became the winner, and European partners supported it.14:["$","$L13",null,{"component":"div","className":"undefined w-full px-[11dvw] h-fit gap-[6dvh] ","direction":"column","dangerouslySetInnerHTML":"$undefined","children":["$L52","$L53",["$","$L1a",null,{"variant":"h3","children":"About project"}],["$","$L1a",null,{"variant":"body2","children":"$54"}]]}]
